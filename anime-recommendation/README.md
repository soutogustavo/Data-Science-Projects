## Recommendation Dashboard

Check the recommendations/results using a Stremlit dashboard that I built. 
You can search and see the recommendations by selecting a user.

### Hot to run the dashboard?
Make sure you have installed the Data Sciences libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, [Surprise](https://surpriselib.com/), and [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/). 
Go to the `anime-recommendation` folder and run the code as follows:
```bash
> streamlit run src/main.py
```
